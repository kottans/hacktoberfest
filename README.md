is an annual initiative aimed at encouraging contributions
to open source projects. The initiative is supported by
DigitalOcean.com, dev.to and GitHub.com.
First 50,000 contributors that open 4 pull requests to open source
projects on GitHub and have those approved during October are
eligible to receiving t-shirts and stickers. Some Open Source projects
also offer some perks to contributors.

Contributing to Open Source is easy and there are lots
of opportunities for beginners.
